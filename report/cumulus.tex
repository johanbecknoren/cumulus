\section{Background}
Real time rendering is something that has been almost exclusive to game development where new games demands a higher quality to convince gamers to buy that game, instead of others.
This industy leads to a demand for better computer components that allows the games to run smoothly which leads to a decrease in cost for these components as the demand goes up.
This results in cheap and fast components, highly tuned for the computations that games does.
Other industries that faces similar problems can reap the benefits and this is something that is especially applicable for the visual effects (VFX) industry.

The general workflow for a VFX company is to create scenes with models that are interacting with each other and real people.
While working the artists handles simple place holders that represents the final output and when they think they are done, they push the work to a rendering farm for rendering.
To render a scene takes time, these super computers needs to calculate how the light interacts in the scene, resulting in a high quality estimation of how the scene looks.
But the interface that the artists are working with is often of much less quality then the final output, something that moves testing from the local computer to the farm.
This would lead to a real time output for changes made to simulations and models.

Therefore a lot of resent research has been aimed at moving work from the CPU that is not optimized for graphics computations to the GPU which converts application from offline to real time rendering.
